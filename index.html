          </div>
 
          <p class="">I have nearly 50 years of family history in Dana Point.   My wife, Ginny, and I moved here in 1971 and we built our home a few years later.  I was elected to a Director position on the Tri Cities Municipal Water District in 1978.  I served in that role for 16 years.  I was a member of the Board of Directors of the Capistrano Bay Park and Recreation District for 8 years.  I served as General Manager of the Capistrano Beach Sanitary District for five years and as Manager of the Capistrano Beach County Water District for about a year.  In 1993 I was selected as General Manager of the Mammoth Community Water District and continued in this role for eleven years.  Following this assignment I was selected to Manage the Crescenta Valley Water District in La Crescenta where I served for eleven years
          </p>
          <p class="">In 2015 I retired and Ginny and I returned to live full time in our home.  With that background, I believe I have the longest and most in-depth knowledge of water history and industry practices of any candidate running for SCWD.  By education I’m a Civil Engineer and a registered professional engineer in the State of California.  With my career in water/wastewater I’ve got the knowledge and experience to know what’s necessary for SCWD to successfully fulfill it’s mission of keeping water flowing, remain affordable, and promote environmental responsibility.  SCWD employees also know what’s necessary and work every day to deliver on the District’s mission statement.  They are the most important and valuable asset the District has.
          </p>
          <p class="">I’m fiscally conservative (my wife might say cheap)!  I treat rate payers’s  money in the same conservative fashion.  After all, I’m a ratepayer too.  I keep a careful watch on spending to be sure ratepayers are being well served, costs are controlled as closely as possible, and there is a positive benefit to the customers from what is spent.
          </p>
          <p>
            There is a significant portion of SCWD’s water and wastewater bills that is collected on the property tax bills.  In fact all of the wastewater charges are on the tax bill and about one third to one half of the water bill is on the tax bill.  In combination with the charges for water consumed, which is sent in monthly bills to customers, SCWD has water and sewer rates that are among the highest in South Orange County.  
          </p>
          <p>
            In recent years SCWD has undertaken a major sewer tunnel rehabilitation that is projected to cost approximately $100 million.  The project is partly done and is on target for completion in two to three more years.  When done, the District will need to begin loan repayments of over $5 million per year.  The District currently pays $1.5 million per year on debt service. 
          </p>          
          <p>
            Now, the District is contemplating development of an ocean water Desal plant called Doheny Desal.  To date SCWD has spent over $5 million to evaluate and perform environmental review for this project.  Preliminary budgets for this project have put the cost at over $110 million.  
          </p>
          <p>
            Over and above the two projects listed, in the next ten years SCWD has needs for infrastructure repairs, upgrades and replacements that total over $120 million.  In summary the District’s project list totals over $300 million in future work.  For an agency with 12,200 customer meters, that is a tremendous debt load about $25,000 per customer.  That is not a sustainable situation and I will seek to redirect the District’s efforts to reduce these costs, defer projects that can be set back and eliminate projects that are unnecessary.  I will demand a very tight filter for  “want versus need”.
          </p>
          <p>
            Back to Desal, I want to be clear that I’m not anti-Desal.  But there are a number of issues that need more detailed examination.  Desal water will cost more than the water the District currently purchases from MWD.  The project has been proposed as a 5 million gallon per day output plant.  There are many days each year that SCWD does not use 5 million gallons.  Unless there is a willing buyer for the excess production, net water costs from this project will increase even more.  Timing for this project may need to be changed or delayed until a suitable financial plan and perhaps the addition of other project partners can be achieved.  Desal is a “want to” not a “need to” project!  
          </p>
          <p>
            There are many technical questions concerning Desal that have not yet been fully answered.  For example Slant wells are proposed for taking in the seawater.  This technology has been tested, but not used operationally on the scale needed for this project.  What if they fail to perform as expected?  
          </p>
          <p>
            The cost estimations for the project are just that, estimates.  At present the estimate for a 5 million gallon per day Plant is $110 million.  Projects like this one are very prone to scope growth resulting in higher costs.  Desal is touted as a high  reliability water source but that reliability is also dependent on electricity.  A serious earthquake that could disrupt imported water pipelines could also interrupt the electricity supply for days and possibly weeks.  Without power there will be no Desal water.  
          </p>
          <p>
            As you can see, there are a host of questions and issues that deserve careful attention prior to SCWD deciding to place high reliance on Doheny Desal.  I want the District to be very thorough in going through these details and not rush into this just because it sounds good.  
          </p>
          <p>
            A very similar project to Doheny Desal has been given coastal commission approval in Monterey.  We may be able to learn some very important and cost saving measures by following this projects progress and adapting a lessons learned approach to Doheny Desal.
          </p>
          <p>
            I’m not an “all your eggs in one basket” person.  I support SCWD having a portfolio of water sources to draw upon.  This portfolio should consist of imported supplies, recycled water for irrigation, local groundwater from the San Juan Watershed, captured stormwater, and water efficiency/water conservation efforts by the community.  Oh, and perhaps Desal if all the critical questions get answered and fall the right way.  We’ve had highly reliable imported water since the early 1960’s.  SCWD was an early adopter of promoting and providing recycled water.  Recycled water provides approximately 20% of the District’s needs today.  SCWD has a local well and associated treatment facilities and produces about 10% of the water customers use now.  The District is a partner with Santa Margarita Water District in a stormwater recovery project in the San Juan Watershed.  This project could produce local water serving about 5% of the current need.  SCWD customers helped in the last drought by conserving 25% less water than prior to the drought!  So in my portfolio, it looks like we are five for five in hitting all the marks.  It makes me wonder if Desal and the attendant high costs are worth the risks inherent in the project.
          </p>
          <p>
            I ask for your vote so that I can continue to work to see that water and wastewater services will remain safe, reliable, affordable and environmentally responsible.  Thank you!
